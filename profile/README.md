## International Scratch Wiki
This is the organization responsible for maintaining the custom skins and extensions used to power the [Scratch Wikis](https://scratch-wiki.info)

### Contribution
We welcome contributions from anyone to our existing skins and extensions. Simply submit a pull request to any of the repositories. However, please make sure your code follows the style already used in the other files and general PHP and MediaWiki best practices.

### External Usage
These extensions were all designed for the specific use cases of the Scratch Wiki and we cannot guarantee that they will work for more general purposes. Scratch Wiki-specific development takes priority over making extensions applicable elsewhere.
